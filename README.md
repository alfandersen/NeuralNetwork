# NeuralNetwork
<p>Basic neural network with back propagation using sigmoid as activation function.</p>

<p>The back propagation algorithm is based on pseudo code found in Data Mining 3rd Edition by Han, Kamber and Pei [pp. 401]</p>

<p>
Sequential implementation is found in <code>src/NeuralNetwork.java</code><br/>
Parallel extension of NeuralNetwork is found in <code>src/ParallelNeuralNetwork.java</code>
</p>

<p>The network has been tested with tasks of different complexity and sizes ranging from simple XOR determination to the <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/">MNIST handwritten digits</a> dataset. See <code>tests/MNIST</code> for the source code for of this implementation.</p>
